# CS-330-T5621-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization-22EW5
The repository for my CS-330 course where I created 3D graphics of a picture I took. Including a Nintendo Switch!

# How do I approach designing software?
>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Throughout this course I learned how to plot vertices in 3D space and recreate objects from a photo I took. It allowed me to understand the breaking down of more complex shapes and recreating it just out of triangles. The more complex the shape the more triangles needed to be created to create the object as closely as possible. Though for this course we kept things low poly just for the sake of simplicity.

>What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process for any of my objects followed the process of drawing a wireframe mockup of the shape I wanted to create and essentially eyeballing how far apart the vertices would be. I could draw up a side or top down view of the object and then once the basic shape was done I would also decide how I would create those triangles within the shape trying to follow a consistent order.

>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

For future work, though I don't think I have much plans for 3D graphics in either my educational path or career goals, I could apply what I learned to trying to create more complex shapes to better or more closely represent the image, though this would take more time.

# How do I approach developing programs?
>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Seeing how everything I was doing for delevoping this 3D scene was new, I tried to break the objects I was creating into different parts. Though all vertices for the same object were in the same array I would group certain parts that connected together visually by spacing and adding comments to label each part.
I especially took the time to label what each vertex was for that triangle like "Upper left triangle, upper right triangle, bottom right triangle" to be able to imagine what it was creating just by reading it.

Trying to figure out what or where a certain triangle is by glancing at the coordinates is mindboggling so I did my best to make it readable and understandable as I progressed through creating my objects.
>How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factors in through the way in which I wrote my vertices in the array. Each triangle I made I would run the program to see if it worked, where it was and how it looked. I didn't do the entire object and then run I iterated each new triangle and tested. I didn't want to reach the end of a project to find a jumbled mess of planes jutting out in random directions.

I also had to iterate in the way I applied texture, checking after every single change to see if the texture was lining up properly.

>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

If anything I slowly got into the swing of things and it became more natural to create these objects. One thing I learned as I developed was that my approach was evolving in the order of which I drew my triangles. I learned about "winding order" in which the vertices I drew were in a clockwise or counter clockwise rotation pattern. The more vertices and triangles I created the better I got at making sure I remained consistent across the board when creating it, even so much so as to go back to previously created vertex arrays and fixing the order of which certain triangles were being made.


# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
>
I do not believe I have much current use or need (at least planned as of right now) for the skills I have learned here. These skills may be for more of a "pass time" for me than anything educational or professional. I may take some time to create some 3D objects or other graphics just as a hobby or personal entertainment but currently I have no future plans on 3D graphics for my future education or any possible future careers.
